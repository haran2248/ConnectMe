WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:06.270
In this video we're going to wrap up our introductory section to web servers by adding some styles to

00:06.270 --> 00:07.470
our application.

00:07.500 --> 00:11.520
So right now it is mostly unskilled and it's not looking so great.

00:11.520 --> 00:17.160
By the end we'll have a much nicer looking styled version of the app now to kick things off.

00:17.160 --> 00:22.300
I want to close all open editors and collapse all expanded directories.

00:22.350 --> 00:27.210
We're still working with the contents of the web server but I want to start from a nice clean slate

00:27.210 --> 00:31.020
without having a dozen different files open to kick things off.

00:31.020 --> 00:33.280
We're going to focus on two files.

00:33.360 --> 00:41.400
We're going to focus on these styles file in public forward slash C Ss that is styles dot C Ss and we're

00:41.400 --> 00:43.650
going to focus on one of our views.

00:43.710 --> 00:48.770
So in the views folder we can grab a file like index dot HP s.

00:48.810 --> 00:54.750
The goal is to write some styles that's going to make this page look better than the same styles will

00:54.750 --> 01:01.430
get used throughout all of our handlebars templates creating a nice unified feel for the site.

01:01.440 --> 01:06.450
Now if we are going to start by styling this home page let's go ahead and actually pull that one up

01:06.450 --> 01:07.580
in the browser.

01:07.590 --> 01:09.420
This is the weather page.

01:09.420 --> 01:14.740
Now we're ready to actually make this site look a little nicer since this is primarily a back end.

01:14.740 --> 01:18.480
Course we're not going to spend a ton of time focusing on CSX.

01:18.480 --> 01:23.910
So if you're interested in actually learning about CSX and how it works and all of the different ways

01:23.910 --> 01:28.290
it can be used there are plenty of great Udemy courses on the topic.

01:28.290 --> 01:33.750
The goal in this video is for me to just give you some basic styles that's gonna make the application

01:33.750 --> 01:39.510
look a bit nicer but the stuff we're actually going to learn about pertains to node servers and the

01:39.510 --> 01:40.580
back end.

01:40.590 --> 01:44.340
With that said let's add a few styles into the app to get started.

01:44.340 --> 01:50.070
We're going to add some styles for the body element that's going to allow us to setup some global styles

01:50.070 --> 01:55.300
for our funds and it's also going to allow us to center our site content.

01:55.320 --> 02:01.010
Let's go ahead and kick things off in styles dot SS by completely wiping everything we have.

02:01.010 --> 02:08.820
So far all seven lines we're going to end up writing maybe 40 or so lines in this file in this video

02:09.090 --> 02:14.400
and we're going to kick things off by selecting the body and setting up our curly braces.

02:14.410 --> 02:18.810
Now we'll end up putting a few different properties inside of here to start though.

02:18.810 --> 02:22.140
Let's focus on some font related items.

02:22.140 --> 02:26.580
We're going to start with color now when we set color on the body.

02:26.610 --> 02:32.790
We're setting the color for the entire site not just for a single piece of text to show you what I mean.

02:32.790 --> 02:35.850
Let's go ahead and set color to read it temporarily.

02:35.850 --> 02:38.410
That's not the value we're going to use in the long run.

02:38.490 --> 02:45.060
But if I refresh the page I can see that I now have a red header and a red paragraph in the footer.

02:45.060 --> 02:49.010
Now you'll notice that the text links those are not showing up in red.

02:49.020 --> 02:52.620
That's because anchor tags have their own custom colors.

02:52.680 --> 02:57.960
They are blue by default and purple when they've been navigated too though don't worry we'll learn how

02:57.960 --> 03:00.630
to style the colors for those as well.

03:00.630 --> 03:04.050
A bit later in the video now we're not going to use red.

03:04.050 --> 03:11.010
Instead we're going to provide a hex code a hex color code that starts with the hash sign which is shift

03:11.040 --> 03:18.510
3 followed by our hex code which in this case is going to be the number three six times one two three

03:18.780 --> 03:20.790
four five six.

03:20.790 --> 03:26.700
Now if you're not familiar with hex codes it's just a way to represent a color and if you're using design

03:26.700 --> 03:32.880
tools like sketch or photoshop you're going to end up working with colors in this hex format and then

03:32.880 --> 03:37.710
you can translate them from that design tool over to your style sheets.

03:37.710 --> 03:41.110
In this case though I'm providing the hex code for you.

03:41.280 --> 03:45.180
Now this particular hex code is still a pretty dark gray.

03:45.390 --> 03:47.760
So it's going to look kind of like what we had before.

03:47.790 --> 03:50.460
But a little nicer if I refresh the browser.

03:50.490 --> 03:51.250
What do we get.

03:51.300 --> 03:55.650
We can see that it's not quite black but it's definitely pretty close.

03:55.650 --> 04:02.040
So now that we have that in place let's go ahead and customize the font family that is the actual styles

04:02.190 --> 04:08.760
to the individual characters font family is going to allow us to get that done and we're going to start

04:08.760 --> 04:13.940
with a very simple font available on most machines which is just aerial.

04:13.950 --> 04:20.740
This is a nice sans serif font which is going to get rid of those little syrups on the individual characters.

04:20.820 --> 04:26.640
If I go ahead and refresh things we can see we now have a nice clean look from here.

04:26.640 --> 04:30.030
We're gonna go ahead and continue to add some styles to body.

04:30.030 --> 04:36.530
The goal is going to be to center our content so it's not pushed right up against the left hand side.

04:36.600 --> 04:40.740
Now to do that we're going to end up setting a few different properties.

04:40.740 --> 04:49.000
Let's go ahead and start with one that is Max hyphen with max width allows us to set a max with for

04:49.020 --> 04:57.210
the site so I can use a value like six hundred and fifty pixels as an example 650 P X and this is going

04:57.210 --> 05:00.560
to constrain how wide our content can be.

05:00.580 --> 05:05.860
Now if we refresh the browser we're going to notice there's zero change even though behind the scenes

05:05.890 --> 05:12.580
something has changed instead of our content taking up the whole with it now stops right about here.

05:12.580 --> 05:16.270
The goal is to take this block from here to here and center it.

05:16.300 --> 05:19.460
So it goes from about here to about here.

05:19.750 --> 05:25.630
We can do that with a couple properties down below what we're gonna do is set up margin.

05:25.630 --> 05:31.030
So margin is one of two spacing properties will end up using to style or applications.

05:31.030 --> 05:38.020
And in this case we're going to use it to evenly distribute space on the left and the right of the body.

05:38.020 --> 05:41.140
So all of that content shows up in the center.

05:41.140 --> 05:48.100
Now to get that done we provided two values here zero space auto followed by a semicolon.

05:48.220 --> 05:52.550
So zero is the margin value we're applying to the top and the bottom.

05:52.570 --> 05:58.360
I'm not trying to add any additional space above or below the content so we're going to leave that as

05:58.360 --> 06:03.990
zero an auto is going to evenly distribute the space on the left and the right.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.390
So the first value is the margin value for a top and bottom.

06:07.450 --> 06:11.120
The second value is the margin value for left and right.

06:11.290 --> 06:14.830
Now if we go ahead and save the content we are going to notice a difference.

06:14.830 --> 06:16.260
It is now centered.

06:16.330 --> 06:19.540
So we have a block going from about here to about here.

06:19.540 --> 06:22.510
And it's showing up in the center of the browser.

06:22.510 --> 06:27.910
Now if I was to make the browser window smaller we'll see that our content adjusts correctly.

06:27.910 --> 06:31.930
The only problem is that it's jammed up against the left hand sidebar.

06:32.020 --> 06:36.190
We can address that with a another sizing property down below.

06:36.190 --> 06:38.710
We're going to go ahead and set up padding.

06:38.830 --> 06:42.800
We are going to define two values like we did for margin.

06:42.850 --> 06:44.760
The first is going to be zero.

06:44.770 --> 06:48.950
I'm not trying to add any additional space above or below.

06:49.030 --> 06:52.550
And the second is going to be a value like 16 pixels.

06:52.570 --> 06:58.990
So in this case we're putting 16 pixels between our body content and the side of the browser window

06:59.260 --> 07:02.690
that's going to prevent things from getting jammed up against the edge of it.

07:02.710 --> 07:05.170
And if I refresh the browser what do we get.

07:05.200 --> 07:09.910
I can see there's now a little more breathing room making the site look a little nicer.

07:09.910 --> 07:15.850
Now let's bring that browser window back to its full width and we'll go ahead and continue styling our

07:15.850 --> 07:16.340
site.

07:16.390 --> 07:21.030
The next thing we're going to style is the footer and there's a reason that I'm diving into the footer

07:21.040 --> 07:23.310
before diving into the header.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.980
Now the footer markup that lives in footer.

07:26.110 --> 07:26.850
HB Yes.

07:26.860 --> 07:33.610
And over here we are going to make a small change before adding any styles H2 UML provides us with a

07:33.640 --> 07:37.810
footer element which we can use to house our footer content.

07:37.810 --> 07:44.290
So right here I'm going to set up footer and all I'm going to do is take our paragraph and I'm going

07:44.290 --> 07:46.150
to move it right inside.

07:46.150 --> 07:51.130
This is going to allow us to easily expand the footer adding more content inside of there.

07:51.130 --> 07:57.430
Now that we have our footer element set up let's go ahead and move into styles Don CSX and target it

07:57.820 --> 07:58.870
down below.

07:58.870 --> 08:00.550
We are targeting footer.

08:00.550 --> 08:04.830
We are providing a list of style is we want to apply and to kick things off.

08:04.840 --> 08:09.850
I want to talk about the differences between margin and padding if you're not familiar and the best

08:09.850 --> 08:13.590
way to illustrate this is to give our footer a background color.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.250
So right here background.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.680
Let's go ahead and use something very obvious like blue.

08:19.680 --> 08:22.200
Now we're not actually gonna keep this in place.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.860
We're just going to use it to explore a new concept.

08:25.860 --> 08:30.900
So right here we have our blue black round for the footer and you can see that all of the text is sitting

08:30.930 --> 08:32.180
right inside.

08:32.190 --> 08:34.310
Now we have two ways we can space things.

08:34.310 --> 08:40.610
We have the margin and we have the padding the padding is going to put space inside of this box.

08:40.740 --> 08:46.500
And the margin is going to put space outside of the box between the box and other items.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.400
Let's check this out.

08:47.970 --> 08:51.410
So to kick things off what I'm going to do is set up padding.

08:51.660 --> 08:57.130
I'm going to set padding equal to a single value when we use just a single value.

08:57.150 --> 08:59.320
It gets applied on all sides.

08:59.340 --> 09:03.240
So in this case I'm going to use something like 16 pixels.

09:03.240 --> 09:08.580
Now if we go ahead and refresh the page by adding padding we're putting space between the edges of the

09:08.580 --> 09:10.790
box and the content inside.

09:10.800 --> 09:16.280
So between the edge of the blue and our text if I refresh things that's exactly what we get.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.780
We have a much bigger box.

09:18.780 --> 09:24.790
Now the margin it's going to put space between these things outside of the box and the box itself.

09:24.900 --> 09:30.830
That would allow us to put some space between this blue box and the header links above.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.660
So right here let's go ahead and explore that.

09:33.780 --> 09:41.010
That's gonna be margin and I will set the value equal to something like 16 pixels I'm then going to

09:41.010 --> 09:43.090
go ahead and save the style sheet.

09:43.170 --> 09:47.520
And now I can see we have space outside of the box on all sides.

09:47.520 --> 09:52.890
So that's the difference between margin and padding and we'll end up using both throughout this course

09:53.130 --> 09:57.300
and we're actually going to use both right inside of footer to start though.

09:57.330 --> 10:02.880
Let's go ahead and wipe all three styles we set up and we're going to start by setting up color once

10:02.880 --> 10:08.790
again in the footer text color is going to be a bit lighter than the rest of the content making it not

10:08.790 --> 10:15.600
pop quite as much and for this we'll use another hex color code that is the number eight six times which

10:15.600 --> 10:19.500
is a slightly lighter gray than what we had before.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.570
Next up we're going to set up a border.

10:21.750 --> 10:27.530
So we're gonna have a border at the top of the footer by setting border high thin top.

10:27.540 --> 10:33.650
Now you have border life and left border hyphen right and border hyphen bottom for those other borders.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.180
In this case though we don't want all four borders.

10:36.180 --> 10:37.900
I just want a single one.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.840
So we're only going to set up a single one right here.

10:40.860 --> 10:43.240
We provide three values for the border.

10:43.260 --> 10:51.360
It's with I'll use one pixel the type of border like dashed or solid I'll use solid and then the hex

10:51.390 --> 10:52.050
color code.

10:52.050 --> 10:53.250
We'd like to use.

10:53.340 --> 10:55.870
I will be using a very light gray.

10:55.890 --> 11:01.290
That is the letter E six times one two three four five six.

11:01.380 --> 11:06.780
Before we go any further let's go ahead and save the style sheet refresh things in the browser.

11:06.780 --> 11:13.080
And now we can see we do indeed have our border and we do indeed have our lighter text color from here.

11:13.110 --> 11:17.330
Let's go ahead and set up a bit of spacing using padding and margin.

11:17.370 --> 11:24.060
I'm going to start off with margin and we're only going to set the top margin that is going to be space

11:24.210 --> 11:27.560
between the box which in this case ends with the border.

11:27.690 --> 11:31.150
And what's above it which in this case is the NAV items.

11:31.170 --> 11:37.180
Now we could use margin but there's also shorthand for margin top left bottom and right.

11:37.200 --> 11:42.660
So right here I'll just set margin top since that's the only value I actually want to configure and

11:42.660 --> 11:45.220
I'll use 16 pixels for that.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.960
Next up I'm also going to set up the padding.

11:47.970 --> 11:50.850
So I'm going to have a little bit of padding inside of there.

11:50.880 --> 11:57.780
Right here I'm going to set up 16 pixels for the top and the bottom and I'll do zero for the left and

11:57.780 --> 11:58.830
the right.

11:58.860 --> 12:03.360
Now with this in place let's go ahead and refresh our styles to see what we get.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.410
In there we go.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.050
We have a nice styled footer now.

12:07.110 --> 12:10.890
Currently it's still pushed up near the top of the page a bit later.

12:10.890 --> 12:15.960
We'll learn how to make that stick near the bottom where you'd expect the footer to live.

12:15.960 --> 12:21.030
But now that we have the footer styled for the most part we're going to focus on the header.

12:21.060 --> 12:26.900
Now the mark up for the header that lives in a different file that is in header dot HB Yes.

12:26.940 --> 12:33.060
So let's take a moment to crack that open and make a couple of small modifications HDMI l provides us

12:33.060 --> 12:38.550
with a header element that we can use to house our header content and that's what we're gonna use.

12:38.550 --> 12:44.520
I'm going to remove the div in our current tag and swap it out with header and I'll do the same thing

12:44.520 --> 12:51.210
in the closing tag down below and we're gonna do from here is take the H1 and put it right inside so

12:51.240 --> 12:55.790
I'll cut the H1 out down below I'll add it right in and there we go.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.370
This is the final structure.

12:57.390 --> 13:00.540
We're going to end up using for the header now by default.

13:00.540 --> 13:03.190
This isn't going to change the look of the site at all.

13:03.240 --> 13:10.200
But now we can actually target everything with C Ss and customize the look and feel to get started over

13:10.200 --> 13:12.140
in styles dot C Ss.

13:12.160 --> 13:19.560
I'm going to setup a style targeting header and we are going to provide just the margin.

13:19.590 --> 13:25.110
So the goal here is to add a little space between the header and the content below and between the header

13:25.290 --> 13:28.530
and the top of the browser window up above.

13:28.530 --> 13:32.010
So we want to set margin top and margin bottom.

13:32.010 --> 13:35.200
I can do that using margin hyphen top.

13:35.430 --> 13:38.150
I'll use a value of 16 pixels for that.

13:38.280 --> 13:42.620
Then I can also set margin I thin bottom using a bigger value.

13:42.630 --> 13:46.560
Let's go ahead and use something like forty eight pixels not forty seven.

13:46.590 --> 13:47.610
That was a typo.

13:47.610 --> 13:48.650
Perfect.

13:48.660 --> 13:51.540
Now we have a nice set of styles provided.

13:51.540 --> 13:56.400
And if I refresh things we have just a bit more space surrounding our content.

13:56.400 --> 14:02.670
Next up we are going to target our header that is the H one element and we are going to make the font

14:02.700 --> 14:03.660
much bigger.

14:03.660 --> 14:05.270
And we're gonna give it a bit more spacing.

14:05.280 --> 14:12.180
So right here I am going to set up font size to customize how big the font is.

14:12.180 --> 14:16.860
And in this case we're going to use something much bigger like 64 pixels.

14:16.890 --> 14:22.350
I'll also set up margin hyphen bottom to but to put some spacing down below.

14:22.470 --> 14:23.270
Perfect.

14:23.460 --> 14:25.040
I'm going to save the file.

14:25.140 --> 14:26.380
Give things a refresh.

14:26.400 --> 14:30.060
And now we can see our headers really starting to come together.

14:30.090 --> 14:33.590
The next thing we want to style are the navigation items.

14:33.600 --> 14:39.030
So we have our three links in here we want to customize these styles for each.

14:39.030 --> 14:42.210
Now there are a few different ways we can style our links.

14:42.210 --> 14:49.880
One approach would be to just head into styles Don CSX target the a element and then set up our styles.

14:49.890 --> 14:55.200
Now the problem with this is that if we have links anywhere else in our site like somewhere as the help

14:55.200 --> 15:00.990
page content they're going to take on the exact same style as our NAV items which is likely not what

15:00.990 --> 15:01.900
we want.

15:01.920 --> 15:05.760
So we're going to go ahead and customize things just a little bit.

15:05.940 --> 15:11.930
What I'm going to go ahead and do is target using the following selector.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.940
So I'm targeting header then inside of there.

15:14.970 --> 15:16.410
That's what the space does.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.680
I'm looking for any links.

15:18.690 --> 15:23.550
So here we are just targeting our links inside of the header.

15:23.610 --> 15:29.910
And now we can target those specifically without changing links throughout the entire site right here.

15:29.910 --> 15:33.630
Let's go ahead and add a couple of styles for our navigation items.

15:33.630 --> 15:41.770
First up we are going to change the color I will use the Hex Code 8 8 8 8 8 8.

15:41.840 --> 15:48.950
Then we're going to set up a margin property margin hyphen right to put some space between all of these

15:48.950 --> 15:49.630
items.

15:49.730 --> 15:52.920
We can use something pretty small like 16 pixels.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.070
And then lastly we want to remove that underline.

15:56.110 --> 16:03.080
Well it's a stylistic choice and I'm choosing to do that and we do that using text hyphen decoration.

16:03.080 --> 16:08.750
You can set text decoration equal to underline to underline pretty much anything you'd like.

16:08.930 --> 16:13.960
But in this case we don't want to set it to underline which is the default value for our links.

16:13.970 --> 16:18.490
Instead we're going to set it to none which removes that underline.

16:19.010 --> 16:25.130
So now we should see links in a lighter color with a bit of space between them without the underline

16:25.190 --> 16:25.810
showing.

16:25.820 --> 16:28.740
And if I refresh things that is exactly what we get.

16:28.910 --> 16:31.440
Now these sites are really starting to come together.

16:31.460 --> 16:37.310
I can navigate between the pages and I can see that my header and footer styles come with me.

16:37.400 --> 16:42.170
So now that we have the header and footer styled that's where we're gonna stop for this one.

16:42.170 --> 16:46.700
There's a few more things we'll be adding but I don't want this video to get too long as I'm going to

16:46.700 --> 16:49.760
break it into two parts in the next video.

16:49.820 --> 16:55.370
We'll finish this little bonus on styling the application and we'll finally wrap up the section.

16:55.370 --> 16:56.350
I'll see you next time.
